## Abstract
My goal was to build a React app that allows users to generate excuses for many different scenarios. Users are able to specify how many excuses they want as well as a category if they desire. Users can also favorite excuses that they like to reference later.

## Technologies
  - Javascript
  - React
  - Excuser API
  - React Router v6
  - Cypress
